## Overview
The Web-Device-Security project is designed to enhance the security of connected devices through encrypted messaging and real-time data monitoring. It aims to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the confidentiality of data transmitted between IoT devices.

## Features
- **Device Registration**: Each device registers with a unique token for secure access control.
- **Data Encryption**: Utilizes AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for data encryption and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) for secure key exchange.
- **Real-time Communication**: Implements WebSockets for real-time updates and communication between devices.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Follows industry-standard secure coding practices to mitigate common security vulnerabilities.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Laravel (PHP)
- **Frontend**: JavaScript
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Encryption**: AES for symmetric encryption, RSA for asymmetric encryption
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets
